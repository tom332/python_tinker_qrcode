# python_tinker_qrcode
A Windows desktop program developed by Tinker in Python that can recognize simple QR codes in three ways: (1) input the path of the QR code file; (2) open the QR code through the window; (3) read the QR code through the camera. This is my first time to post a program to GitHubï¼ŒIf you see my code, please give me some guidance.
